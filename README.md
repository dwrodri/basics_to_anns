# Neural Networks 101
If you're currently struggling with wrapping your brain  around the math that
happens under the hood of a basic artificial neural network (aNN), then this slide
stack is for you. If you've never seen a neural network before, then this will
probably be a bit of a rough introduction, but still an introduction nonetheless.
For a more proper introductions I would recommend [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).

##What's inside
Currently, just the slide stack! I intend to add some toy implementations of this
aNN in different languages for further guidance, but that's a stretch goal that
might not be reached for some time. Ideally basic implementations will be in the
following languages:
* [x] Initialized repo and uploaded slides in keynote and PDF
* [ ] Implement in python 3.6 (matricized and non-matricized)
* [ ] Implement in C++ (matricized and non-matricized)
